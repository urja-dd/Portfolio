 #### Morse Code

Explore the efficiency of Morse code decoding and its effectiveness in recovering corrupted data compared to Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Morse code, with its simple representation of characters through dots and dashes, has been pivotal in communication for centuries. This project aims to delve into Morse code's robustness in data recovery and its potential applications in modern communication technologies.
